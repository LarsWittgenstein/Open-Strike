# Open Strike Manifesto


## Section 1: The Crisis  
A system that rewards exploitation over human dignity and sustainability is destined to collapse. The current elite have amassed wealth and power by dismantling labor protections, privatizing public goods, and evading accountability.

## Section 2: Our Vision  
We aim to build a new system, not through violent upheaval, but through **collective, non-violent withdrawal** from financial systems and labor markets until systemic change is achieved.

## Section 3: The Method  
Through the development of decentralized tools, resource networks, and recruitment campaigns, we will create a scalable platform that prepares people for self-sufficiency and general strikes.

- **Open-source software for coordination**  
- **Mutual aid networks to distribute resources**  
- **A year-long countdown to strike readiness**

## Section 4: The Goal  
A system that puts people before profit:  
- Democratic ownership of essential industries  
- Wealth redistribution and universal access to basic needs  
- Permanent mechanisms for preventing future elite control  


1. Phase One: Laying the Foundation on GitHub

/software

    - encryption-communication-tools.md  
    - mutual-aid-network-tool.md

    - local-organization-guide.md  
    - legal-rights-handbook.md  


2. Phase Two: Collaborative Software Development

üîπ Step 1: Identify Core Tools to Develop
The Open Strike system will require several key software modules for coordination, recruitment, and logistics. GitHub is ideal for managing distributed contributions to these projects.

üîπ Initial Software Requirements:

    Core Strike Platform: A tool for organizing recruitment drives, tracking participant readiness, and managing local group coordination.
        Technologies: Consider using decentralized ledgers or peer-to-peer networks to avoid central points of failure.

    Encrypted Communication Channels: Build or integrate privacy-focused messaging for strike leaders and participants.
        Use existing solutions like Matrix (Element) or develop custom secure chat clients using end-to-end encryption.

    Mutual Aid Resource Network: Software for managing and distributing pooled resources during the strike.
        It should allow resource allocation across regions and handle emergency requests from participants.

üîπ Step 2: Leverage Open-Source Contributors

    Post calls for developers within open-source communities, cryptography forums, and cooperative networks.
    Provide guidelines for contributors: Define coding standards, security requirements, and contribution pathways.

üîπ Step 3: Decentralize Hosting Early

    Avoid relying solely on GitHub as the central repository.
    Mirror the repository on other platforms like GitLab, Codeberg, or decentralized options (e.g., IPFS-based repositories). This ensures the project cannot be taken down easily.


3. Phase Three: Community Building and Recruitment

üîπ Step 1: Spread Awareness via Decentralized Networks

    Avoid traditional social media (which is heavily monitored and can suppress large-scale movements). Instead, focus on:
        Encrypted messaging apps: Signal, Matrix, Telegram (with caution), Session
        Privacy-oriented forums and platforms: Lemmy (decentralized Reddit alternative), Mastodon
        Dark web spaces: For sensitive recruitment discussions

üîπ Step 2: Establish Local and Regional Nodes

    Encourage participants to form local chapters that act as recruitment hubs and logistics coordinators.
    The GitHub repository should include a local organization guide (local-organization-guide.md) with tips on how to:
        Host small-scale meetings
        Identify key local leaders
        Integrate community-specific needs into the broader strategy



4. Phase Four: Security and Operational Resilience

üîπ Step 1: Prioritize Cybersecurity Measures Early

    Ensure all contributors, leaders, and participants are trained in operational security (OpSec).
    Include a security guide in the repository outlining best practices:
        Using VPNs and Tor
        Avoiding metadata leaks
        Encrypting communications and data

üîπ Step 2: Build a ‚ÄúRed Team‚Äù for Threat Analysis

    Recruit security experts who can test the system‚Äôs vulnerabilities and simulate potential attacks from elite-controlled entities (e.g., state surveillance, corporate espionage).

üîπ Step 3: Backup Critical Data Across Multiple Locations

    Ensure the manifesto, core strategy documents, and software have distributed backups in case of takedown attempts.



5. Phase Five: Gradual Deployment and Early Demonstrations

üîπ Step 1: Organize Small-Scale Trial Runs

    Before launching the full strike, conduct localized or industry-specific slowdowns to test the system‚Äôs resilience and gather feedback.
    These trials will:
        Build confidence among participants
        Demonstrate credibility to skeptics
        Provide data-driven improvements to the system

üîπ Step 2: Publicize Small Wins

    As early victories accumulate, use decentralized media outlets to highlight progress.
    Share stories of successful mutual aid programs, local strikes, or policy reversals triggered by the system.



Once launched, the very existence of the system will act as a permanent check on greed, abuse, and inequality. What starts as a GitHub repository could eventually become the backbone of a movement that reshapes society.

Let‚Äôs plant the seed. üå±
