We find ourselves at an inflection point.

The elite has grown so powerful that they are now mocking us openly.

Not because they feel as though they are over the concerns of the common man, but because they are.


The system of governance has been captured by special interests groups.
It no longer works for us.

We shall, in turn, no longer work for it.

That is how balance will return and the people seize power once again.
