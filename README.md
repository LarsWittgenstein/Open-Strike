We find ourselves at an inflection point.

The elite has grown so powerful that they are now mocking us openly.

Not because they feel as though they are over the concerns of the common man, but because they are.


The system of governance has been captured by special interests groups.
It no longer works for us.

We shall, in turn, no longer work for it.

That is how balance will return and the people seize power once again.


The Open Strike initiative aims for the creation of an open, decentralized system of solidarity culminating in a massive general strike of unprecedented proportions.

In short:
1. Collaborate openly on building this system
2. Assemble knowledge and resources to prepare ourselves
3. Build out technological infrastructure for coordination
4. Set a one year timer
5. Large-scale recruitment
6. All participant cease participation in the financial system, only working and saving
7. Each household hoarding vital resources (food, water) to last months
8. Once the gong strikes, all participants cease work altogether except for vital services
